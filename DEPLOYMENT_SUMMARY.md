## 🎯 Deployment Answer: Deploy ONLY `backend-trustbridge`

### ✅ What to Deploy
**`backend-trustbridge/`** - The REST API
- Consumed by WhatsApp bot
- Consumed by website
- Consumed by future mobile apps
- Provides all business logic
- Handles all integrations

### ❌ What NOT to Deploy

**`be-offchain/`** - Blockchain scripts
- Run manually from local machine
- Only needed for token deployment (one-time)
- Run mint/swap operations when testing
- **Not needed for API operations**

**`CardanoPay/`** - Frontend
- Deploy separately to Vercel/Netlify
- Consumes the backend API
- Different deployment process

**`Trustbridge-SmartContracts/`** - Smart contracts
- Already deployed to Cardano blockchain
- Policy IDs already generated
- No need to redeploy
